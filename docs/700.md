<p>Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node&#39;s value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn&#39;t exist, you should return NULL.</p>

<p>For example,&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2
</pre>

<p>You should return this subtree:</p>

<pre>
      2     
     / \   
    1   3
</pre>

<p>In the example above, if we want to search the value <code>5</code>, since there is no node with value <code>5</code>, we should return <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>Note that an empty tree is represented by <code>NULL</code>, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as&nbsp;<code>[]</code>, not <code>null</code>.</p>
