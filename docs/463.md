<p>You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.</p>

<p>Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).</p>

<p>The island doesn&#39;t have &quot;lakes&quot; (water inside that isn&#39;t connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don&#39;t exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.</p>
